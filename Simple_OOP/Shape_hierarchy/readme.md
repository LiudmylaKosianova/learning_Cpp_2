### Shape Hierarchy

**Classes**: Shape, Circle, Rectangle, Triangle

**Task**: Create a base class Shape with a pure virtual method area(). Implement derived classes Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle that calculate their respective areas. Use polymorphism to store different shapes and calculate their areas.
*Focus*: Inheritance, polymorphism, virtual methods, and destructors.
